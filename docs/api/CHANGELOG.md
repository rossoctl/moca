# Control-plane API changelog

The version is `info.version` in [openapi.yaml](openapi.yaml): the minor is bumped for additive
changes, the major only with a `/v2` ([change policy](../reference/change-policy.md), decision 5).

## 1.7.0

Template host agents and their routes ([#741](https://github.com/rossoctl/moca/issues/741)), per the
[template lifecycle spec](../specs/2026-11-03-template-lifecycle-and-provenance-design.md) §6.1 and
§8.2. Every change is additive; the routes mount on both route profiles, need `SH_PROVENANCE_DIR`
for the builds (else `400 invalid_request`), and answer only a host listed in `SH_TEMPLATE_HOSTS`
(else `401 unauthorized`).

- New security scheme `hostToken`: one template host's bearer, `SH_HOST_TOKEN_<ID>`. The host in
  the path must be the one whose token is presented; no user, admin, janitor or egress token is
  accepted.
- New POST /v1/hosts/{host}/inventory: what the host holds (`holds`, each a `template` and its
  `manifestHash`) and its limits (`limits`: `activeLimit`, `idleLimitSeconds`, `buildConcurrency`,
  `diskFreeGb`, `diskFloorGb`).
- New POST /v1/hosts/{host}/builds/claim `{max}`: up to 4 queued builds, oldest first and subjects
  in turn, each moved to `building` and held by the host, with its job: the template id, the
  handle, the image and the spec as `template-build.sh` reads it (the template's id and the create's
  image always win over the spec's own; the guest size is always `guest_ram_mb`, the value the
  policy checked), and the gate record's path when the create had one.
- New GET /v1/hosts/{host}/blobs/{digest}: a stored document (a gate record) by sha256, base64 of
  its exact bytes.
- New POST /v1/hosts/{host}/builds/{build}/log (at most 200 entries a call; a build keeps its
  last 1000) and POST /v1/hosts/{host}/builds/{build}/report, whose `event` is `building` or
  `probing`; `failed` with `step` and `message`; or `built` with `templateRecord` and `manifest`,
  each file as a string. A report answers only a build this host claimed (else `404 not_found`);
  a failed or cancelled build takes no more. On `built` the control plane stores both files,
  writes a `build` record, checks them against the create's request and registers the build (its
  `buildId` becomes the manifest hash; a template's first registered build takes `default`) or
  rejects it with `reason.rule`, writing a `check` record (`at: registration`) either way.

## 1.6.0

Sandbox modes ([lease-mode spec](../specs/2026-11-08-sbx-lease-mode-design.md) §8.1–§8.2), served
only on the `sandbox` route profile.

- `Sandbox` gains `mode` (`per-exec`, `lease` or `lease+processes`), `idleTimeoutS` (0 = the worker's
  default) and `modeEpoch`. A sandbox created `per-exec` starts at epoch 0, one created in a lease
  mode at 1.
- POST /v1/sandboxes accepts `mode` (default `per-exec`) and `idleTimeoutS` (30 to
  `SH_SANDBOX_IDLE_CEILING_S`, whose default is 1800; omitted, the worker's default of 300 s; an
  explicit 0 is 400 `invalid_request`).
- New PUT /v1/sandboxes/{id}/mode: changes the mode and the idle timeout, raises `modeEpoch` by 1 on
  every accepted call, audits `sandbox_mode_changed`, and returns the sandbox with a `setModeToken`
  for the client's `LeaseControl set_mode`.
- New POST /v1/sandboxes/{id}/mode-token: a `setModeToken` for the mode and epoch the record holds
  now, raising nothing.
- Both mode routes are owner only (an admin gets 404 on another user's sandbox) and take only the
  owner's user API token; a sandbox token is a 401. A set-mode token is a JWT with
  `typ: moca-sandbox-mode+jwt`, valid 300 s.
- New error code `mode_not_allowed` (403): a lease mode the deployment's `SH_SANDBOX_MODES_ALLOWED`
  (default `per-exec`, so no lease mode until an operator lists one) does not list. `per-exec` is
  always allowed.
- Sandbox tokens gain the claims `mode`, `mode_epoch` and `idle_timeout_s`. A token without them
  reads as `per-exec`, epoch 0.
- Narrowing the policy downgrades existing sandboxes at their next token mint. A sandbox token or
  `mode-token` minted for a sandbox whose lease mode `SH_SANDBOX_MODES_ALLOWED` no longer lists first
  sets it to `per-exec` at the next epoch, audited as `sandbox_mode_changed` with the reason
  `mode_not_allowed`. A lowered `SH_SANDBOX_IDLE_CEILING_S` clamps the `idle_timeout_s` claim; the
  stored `idleTimeoutS` and the epoch are unchanged.

## 1.5.0

Self-serve template create, gated by policy ([#737](https://github.com/rossoctl/moca/issues/737)),
per the [template lifecycle spec](../specs/2026-11-03-template-lifecycle-and-provenance-design.md)
§4 and §8. Every change is additive; all new routes mount on both route profiles and need
`SH_PROVENANCE_DIR` (else `400 invalid_request`).

- New POST /v1/templates `{id, image, spec, gateRecord?, profile?, visibility?}`: any enrolled
  client creates a template from an image pinned by digest. The deployment's policy checks it before
  anything is queued; an admitted create answers `202 {templateId, buildId: null, build, status:
queued}`, `build` being the build's path under a `b-<26 hex>` handle, and writes `create`, `gate`
  (with a gate record) and `check` provenance records. A create with the same image, spec, profile
  and gate record sha256 as a build of the caller's own template that is registered or on its way
  answers that build with `reused: true` (`200` when registered, `202` before); a failed or rejected
  build is never reused.
- New POST /v1/templates/{id}/builds (the owner, or an admin: a new image or spec, the same body and
  answers) and POST /v1/templates/{id}/builds/{build}/cancel (the owner, or an admin: a queued,
  building or probing build becomes `failed` with `reason.step` `cancelled`, and a `build` record).
- New GET /v1/policy (any enrolled client) and PUT /v1/policy (an admin; each change a `policy`
  record naming who), with the `Policy` (`moca-template-policy/1`: profiles with their rules and
  size envelope, allowed registries, trusted gate records by sha256, quotas) and `PolicyView`
  schemas. The default policy has a `base` and a `benchmark` profile.
- New GET /v1/quota: the caller's limits and use (`templates`, owned with a build registered or on
  its way there, a new build of one that holds no slot checked like a new id; `buildsQueued`,
  queued, building or probing; `active`; `owned`, template ids owned in any status, a failed or
  cancelled-only one included, 200 when the policy does not set it), and on the sandbox profile the
  live-sandbox cap (`sandboxes`). `owned` counts retired ids too, and a retired id is never served
  again, so it is in effect a lifetime cap per subject: a user who retires as they go reaches it in
  time, and only an admin raises it.
- New error codes `policy_refused` (422, with `rule`, the gating rule's id from
  `deploy/sbx/template-onboarding/governance/GATING-RULES.md`) and `template_exists` (409: ids are
  unique per deployment, the first creator owns one). `quota_exceeded` on a create names the quota
  (`quota`: `templates`, `buildsQueued` or `owned`). The `Error` schema adds `rule` and `quota`.
- `TemplateBuild` adds `handle` (the create's handle; equal to `buildId` for an imported build) and
  `reason` (why a build failed or was rejected), and GET /v1/templates/{id}/builds/{build} also
  finds a build by its handle.
- A refused create is recorded as a `check` provenance record only on an existing template's stream
  the caller may write; a refusal on an id no template holds writes one audit line instead
  (`template_create_refused`, with the subject, `templateId` and the failed `rules`).

Upgrade note (the policy fails closed):

- X12 applies under every profile, `base` included: a `skip_git_identity_check: true` that no gate
  record backs is refused (`422 policy_refused`, rule `X12`). A `base` client sends a gate record
  showing commits refused (X5: `agent_can_commit: "no"`, `git_identity: "none"`), or drops the skip:
  the build host's git identity check then needs git with an identity in the image, or no git at all
  once the build-snapshot change in [#757](https://github.com/rossoctl/moca/pull/757) is in.
- A stored policy (`<SH_PROVENANCE_DIR>/policy.json`) that names a rule id outside the ones the
  check acts on (X1, X10, X11, X12, X14, X15), or an `envelope.exact` that is not two positive whole
  numbers, is refused when it is read: every create and every read of the policy or the quota fails
  until an admin PUTs a valid policy, instead of the policy silently enforcing nothing. So read
  `GET /v1/policy` and fix it **before** upgrading: afterwards only `PUT /v1/policy` succeeds (the
  file itself stays readable on the volume).

## 1.4.0

The template store and its read API ([#736](https://github.com/rossoctl/moca/issues/736)), per the
[template lifecycle spec](../specs/2026-11-03-template-lifecycle-and-provenance-design.md) §3-§4.
Every change is additive.

- GET /v1/templates mounts on both route profiles (it was `sandbox` only), so a Moca Pi brain and a
  stock agent read the same templates. Its first fields (`id`, `description`, `tools`) are unchanged;
  each template adds `owner` (null for one the deployment declared), `visibility`, `onboarding`,
  `readiness`, `tags` and `builds`, and the list adds a `hosts` block, empty until a later issue's
  host agent reports.
- New GET /v1/templates/{id}, GET /v1/templates/{id}/builds, GET /v1/templates/{id}/builds/{build}
  (each build with its own `spec`, seed included) and GET /v1/templates/{id}/tags (each tag's build,
  and when and by whom it was set), on both profiles.
- New `Template` and `TemplateBuild` schemas. A build's `readiness` comes from the relay's presence
  records: `active` with its `capacity`, `inactive`, or `unknown` when presence cannot be read.
  An imported build's id is `imported:<12 hex>`; a built one's is `sha256:<manifest hash>`.
- POST /v1/sandboxes takes `template` as `id`, `id:tag` or `id@<build id>`, resolved to one
  registered build at creation and kept for the sandbox's life; an unknown one is still
  `400 unknown_template`. The `Sandbox` schema adds `buildId` and `templateManifestHash` (null for an
  imported build, which names no snapshot).
- New error code `template_not_found` (404): an unknown template or build, or a `private` template
  the caller does not own.
- `SH_PROVENANCE_DIR` keeps the templates in a store on a persistent volume, with the provenance
  records ([#730](https://github.com/rossoctl/moca/issues/730)): `SH_SANDBOX_TEMPLATES` is imported
  into an empty store once and ignored after that. Unset, templates come from the env list at every
  start, as before.

## 1.3.0

Async turns: the owner-scoped submission API
([#387](https://github.com/rossoctl/moca/issues/387)) and the dequeue-time credential exchange
([#388](https://github.com/rossoctl/moca/issues/388)), per the
[async fan-out spec](../specs/2026-11-05-p6-async-fan-out-design.md) and
[ADR-0047](../adrs/0047-p6-async-fan-out-in-worker-drain.md). The M1 slice: a working drain under
`MOCA_TENANCY=single`.

- New POST /v1/sessions/{id}/turns (202 with the turn id), GET /v1/sessions/{id}/turns/{turnId} and
  DELETE /v1/sessions/{id}/turns/{turnId} (queued turns only). Owner-scoped: another user's session
  answers 404. `idempotencyKey` defaults to the session id, so a resubmission is deduplicated rather
  than queued behind. Documented in 1.2.0's document by oversight; recorded here.
- New `TurnStatus` schema and `turnId` path parameter. The nine turn states are pinned against the
  server's own list by a contract test.
- New POST /internal/turn-credentials, behind the existing `exchangeToken` scheme: a worker presents
  the turn id it read off the queue and gets back the credential resolved from the turn record. No
  credential and no bearer token ever travels in the work queue (MI1 §6.5). A pure read — it does not
  move the turn to `running`. The `turnId` must be the `t-<uuid>` shape the control plane mints;
  anything else is 400 `invalid_request`, refused before Redis is read. The response also carries
  the `envelope` the worker runs, with the turn's `sessionId` attached, so a claim is one round trip.
- New GET /metrics, admin-only: `counters.async_quota_refusals`, the count of submissions refused
  with 429 `async_quota_exhausted`. The control plane reports it because it is the side that refuses
  them — a worker never sees a submission that was never enqueued (§7). Process-local and reset by a
  restart; with more than one replica each request reports one replica's share.
- New error codes `turn_not_cancellable` (409, cancelling a turn that is not queued),
  `turn_not_claimable` (409, claiming a cancelled or terminal turn), `turn_not_found` (404),
  `async_quota_exhausted` (429, `MOCA_ASYNC_QUEUED_PER_OWNER` non-terminal turns already held),
  `async_tenancy_unsupported` (501, async under `MOCA_TENANCY=multi`) and
  `workload_runs_unavailable` (501, a submission naming a `workloadId`). Either 501 is answered
  before the quota is touched, so a request that can never be served is never reported as a 429 and
  leaves no record, no queue entry and no quota slot behind (§4.2).
- `async: true` on the harness's own turn route stays removed and still answers 400 `async_removed`;
  these routes are its replacement.

Upgrade note: `LEAF_RESULT_TTL_SECONDS` is now read by the harness tier through the control plane's
own strict parse, because both write the same result keys and a drained turn's result must outlive
nothing less than its record. A value that is not a positive integer refuses to BOOT there, where a
lenient `parseInt` used to read it as `NaN` and fail every result write instead. Surrounding
whitespace is trimmed, so an env file's trailing space or CRLF still boots; blank still means the
default (86400).

Interim, and named as such: /internal/turn-credentials returns a resolved credential rather than the
MI1 S2 grants, there is no `turn_exp`, and `MOCA_TENANCY=multi` refuses async at both the submission
and the claim. M2 mints grants for both audiences with a `turn_exp` and lifts that gate.

## 1.2.0

The sandbox service's routes ([SBX0 spec](../specs/2026-10-15-sbx0-internal-sandbox-service-design.md) §5.1),
served only by a control plane on the `sandbox` route profile (`SH_ROUTE_PROFILE=sandbox`); a moca
control plane answers 404 for all of them.

- New GET /v1/templates; POST and GET /v1/sandboxes; GET and DELETE /v1/sandboxes/{id}; and
  POST /v1/sandboxes/{id}/token, which mints a sandbox token for Exec (owner only, admins included).
- New GET /v1/janitor/sandboxes for the host janitor, behind the new `janitorToken` security scheme
  (`SH_JANITOR_TOKEN`).
- New `Sandbox` schema and `sandboxId` path parameter (`sbx-` plus 26 lowercase hex characters).
- New error codes `not_enrolled` (403), `sandbox_not_found` (404), `sandbox_terminated` (409, with
  `reason`), `name_conflict` (409), `quota_exceeded` (429) and `unknown_template` (400).
- Every sandbox route, the janitor's included, keeps its records in Redis and can answer
  `503 redis_unavailable`; POST /v1/sandboxes can answer `400 invalid_json`.
- GET /v1/discovery names the route `profile`, and on `sandbox` answers `execEndpoint` and `execCa`.
- POST /v1/auth/device/token and POST /v1/auth/token can answer `403 not_enrolled` on the `sandbox`
  profile (a subject not in, or since removed from, `SH_ALLOWED_SUBJECTS`); a refused refresh also
  revokes that login.

## 1.1.0

Per-session model selection ([spec](../specs/2026-10-14-per-session-model-selection-design.md)).

- New error codes `model_unavailable` (400) and `model_catalog_unavailable` (503).
- /internal/credentials returns the session's `model` when it names one.
- POST /v1/sessions accepts `model`; the session view shows it; new PATCH /v1/sessions/{id} switches it.
- New GET /v1/models and GET /v1/sessions/{id}/models.
