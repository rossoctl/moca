# Moca — Template Onboarding Guide

> **Preview.** Sandbox templates, their onboarding tools and the self-serve template API are
> implemented but not yet declared Stable; interfaces and limits may change. This guide describes
> the units proposed with #730 to #752; a section whose unit changes in review changes with it.

This guide takes a container image to a **sandbox template**: a named image that a client, or an
agent session, asks for by id, and whose commands then run in microVMs restored from that image's
snapshot. It walks through two worked examples end to end: Moca's public sandbox image (anyone can
reproduce it) and a SWE-bench instance (a benchmark case, used here as an example: nothing in Moca's
templates is benchmark-specific). It was validated against an SBX0 deployment: the control plane
and relay on OpenShift, and the workers on a bare-metal KVM host. The same flow has also run
self-serve through the API, and for two kinds of client (a stock agent and Moca Pi) on one control
plane and one build (§8).

- **A template is one worker serving one snapshot.** Onboarding is: build a snapshot from the image,
  check it in a real microVM, give it a worker, register it, use it, and retire it when a new
  image replaces it.
- **Everything for templates is in [this folder](README.md):** the tools, the two sample specs,
  their tests, and pointers to the related files elsewhere.
- The short reference for the same steps is [`deploy/sbx/template-onboarding/ONBOARDING.md`](ONBOARDING.md).
  Deploying SBX0 itself is [`deploy/sbx/README.md`](../README.md) and
  [`RUNBOOK.md`](../RUNBOOK.md); using a sandbox is the
  [user guide](../../../docs/sbx/user-guide.md); templates in Moca's own agent sessions are designed in
  `docs/specs/2026-10-30-session-sandbox-templates-design.md`.
- **Every host and registry below is a placeholder:** `sbx-api.example.com`, `registry.example.com`.
  No real host, account id or token appears here.

**In a hurry?** §2 is the whole flow on one page; §4 is the public-image example as
copy-pasteable commands; §6 is a client choosing between the two sample templates.

## 1. Mental model (read this first)

1. **A sandbox runs every command in a fresh microVM** restored from its template's golden
   snapshot, with the sandbox's own `/workspace` attached. Files in `/workspace` persist across
   commands; nothing else does.
2. **One worker (`microvm-worker`) serves one snapshot.** A template is a name for a worker, so a new
   image of a template is a new snapshot and a new worker; the old one drains.
3. **The client chooses the template** when it creates a sandbox (`mocactl sbx create --template ID`,
   `POST /v1/sandboxes {template}`), and a sandbox keeps its worker for life.

### What a snapshot holds

Every template is its own bootable image: there is no common Moca image underneath. What templates
share is Moca's thin boot layer, which `build-snapshot.sh` copies into each snapshot.

| In a snapshot        | Shared by every template?                                                               | Size (a 4 GiB SWE-bench guest)    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `kernel`             | yes: the host's one guest kernel (`--kernel`)                                           | ~28 MB                            |
| `agent`              | yes: Moca's guest agent, from `remote-worker`                                           | ~3 MB                             |
| `/sbin/init`         | yes: Moca's init (mounts, `/dev/fd`, `/var` overlay, `HOME`), inside the rootfs         | a few KB                          |
| `rootfs`             | no: an ext4 image of the template's container image (OS, toolchain, repository, `/var`) | 3.5-9 GB                          |
| `memfile`, `vmstate` | no: the guest's RAM and CPU state after it booted                                       | the guest's RAM (4 GiB), a few KB |

So each template costs 7-14 GB of disk, mostly its rootfs and memfile, and disk is what limits how
many templates a host holds (§9). Within one template every VM is restored from the same files by
hardlink and gets only its own workspace disk, so more sandboxes of a template cost little.

### Where things run

| Component              | Runs on                                     | Does                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `template-build.sh`    | the KVM host, as root                       | image → snapshot, checked in a microVM → a template record           |
| `template-register.sh` | the operator's machine                      | record → SBX0's inputs (`SBX_WORKERS`, the templates file)           |
| `setup.sh`             | the operator's machine, against the cluster | mints the worker's token and bundle; restarts the control plane only |
| `install-host.sh`      | the KVM host, as root                       | installs the worker, which attaches to the relay                     |
| `mocactl sbx`          | anywhere                                    | lists templates, creates sandboxes, runs commands                    |

### Names

For a template id `ID` and an image digest `sha256:abcdef012345…`:

| What      | Name                                               |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| snapshot  | `ID-abcdef012345` (the first 12 hex of the digest) |
| worker id | `sbx_<ID with - as _>_abcdef012345`                |
| record    | `$SBX_SRV/templates/<snapshot>.json`               |

## 2. The flow on one page

| #   | Where    | Command                                                           | Check                                                                     |
| --- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | anywhere | write `spec.json` (§3)                                            | `template-build.sh` validates every field first                           |
| 2   | KVM host | `template-build.sh spec.json --kernel K [--registry H]`           | digest, `/etc/hosts`, the probe in a microVM; a failure publishes nothing |
| 3   | operator | `template-register.sh --env-file F record.json`                   | one worker per template; an update keeps the old worker                   |
| 4   | operator | `setup.sh --env-file F`                                           | the control plane rolls; the relay does not                               |
| 5   | KVM host | `install-host.sh BUNDLE --snapshot S --budget-mb N [--no-egress]` | the worker attaches                                                       |
| 6   | client   | `mocactl sbx create --template ID`                                | the sandbox runs on that template's image                                 |
| 7   | both     | new image: steps 1-5 again, then `--retire` the old worker        | its live sandboxes have ended                                             |

## 3. The template spec

A JSON file, schema `moca-sbx-template-spec/1`. Every field is checked before anything runs
(`template-build.sh`):

| Field                     | Meaning                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                      | what clients ask for: `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,30}$`; the same across versions                                             |
| `image`                   | `repository@sha256:<digest>`, never a tag; a repository with no host takes it from `--registry`                         |
| `guest_ram_mb`, `vcpus`   | the guest's size, fixed in the snapshot                                                                                 |
| `guest_home`              | optional, a writable `HOME` under `/tmp` (the rootfs is read-only)                                                      |
| `skip_git_identity_check` | `true` for an image that refuses agent commits on purpose                                                               |
| `guest_home_gitconfig`    | optional, `true`: copy the image's `/root/.gitconfig` into `guest_home`; refused with `skip_git_identity_check`         |
| `egress`                  | `false`: no network at all (`--no-egress`); `true`: the host's allowlisted egress                                       |
| `seed`                    | a bash command that fills a new sandbox's empty `/workspace`, or `""`                                                   |
| `probe`                   | `{cmd, timeout_s, expect_rc, expect[]}`: run after the seed in the restored VM; passes on the exit code and every regex |
| `description`, `tools`    | what clients see in `GET /v1/templates`                                                                                 |
| `etc_hosts_sha256`        | optional: the build stops unless the rootfs's `/etc/hosts` has this hash                                                |

**Which images a self-serve create accepts** is the deployment's policy: `allowedRegistries` (by
registry host; `<default>` is a reference with no host, which the host pulls from its configured
registry), and, per registry, `allowedRepositories` naming the repositories it admits (exact path
segments, or `prefix/*`). Docker Hub's key is `docker.io` (`index.docker.io` normalizes to it), so
write a Docker Hub image with its host, `docker.io/library/python@sha256:…`. Don't work around a
refusal by writing another host for the same registry (`registry-1.docker.io/…`): that host is its
own key, refused unless an admin lists it, and listing it would bypass the repository allowlist.

**Which profile a create names** is its gate: the policy's profiles, listed by `GET /v1/policy`.
`base` needs no gate record. `benchmark` needs a gate record that passed and that an admin trusts
(`trustedGateRecords`). Two self-attested profiles accept the creating subject's own
gate record, for that subject's templates only, which stay private until an admin trusts the record:
`benchmark-self` (the benchmark rules, offline) and `general-self` (no X11, so the KVM host's
allowlisted egress). A build shows `attestation: deployment | self`. A profile exists on a deployment
only once its stored policy lists it, so check `GET /v1/policy` first. See the subject trust spec,
`docs/specs/2026-11-08-subject-trust-gate-records-design.md`.

### The probe must be shareable

The probe proves the image's toolchain works in a microVM, not that a task is solvable. For a
benchmark, **use a public test target, never the tests that grade a fix**: their names and counts
are answer-key material. Match the runner's output as it prints it (§10 has two ways this went
wrong).

## 4. Example 1: Moca's public sandbox image

Moca's own sandbox image, `ghcr.io/rossoctl/moca-remote-worker`, is public, so this example needs no
registry key. It is the image SBX0's `default` template runs on. This exact spec was built with
`template-build.sh` (with `--egress-ca`, for egress credentials) and its probe passed in the restored
VM.

### 4.1 Write the spec

This spec is `examples/default.json` in this folder:

```json
{
  "schema": "moca-sbx-template-spec/1",
  "id": "default",
  "image": "ghcr.io/rossoctl/moca-remote-worker@sha256:eed901b838bf11e16054fccfb38af600a6e61d74dd52907af0750bba13ecbed3",
  "guest_ram_mb": 256,
  "vcpus": 1,
  "egress": true,
  "seed": "",
  "probe": {
    "cmd": "git --version && python3 -c 'print(6*7)' && rg --version | head -1",
    "timeout_s": 120,
    "expect_rc": 0,
    "expect": ["^git version ", "^42$", "^ripgrep "]
  },
  "description": "Moca's sandbox image: bash, git, Python 3, ripgrep",
  "tools": ["bash", "git", "python3", "rg"]
}
```

`egress: true` gives the guest the host's allowlisted egress (GitHub by default,
[RUNBOOK](../RUNBOOK.md#guest-egress)). Use `false` for a template that must stay offline.

### 4.2 Build and probe on the KVM host

```bash
sudo deploy/sbx/template-onboarding/template-build.sh deploy/sbx/template-onboarding/examples/default.json --kernel /path/to/vmlinux
```

Expected output, ending:

```
build-snapshot.sh: verify command exited 0; the last of its output:
...
template-build: the probe passed
==> built template default: snapshot default-eed901b838bf, worker sbx_default_eed901b838bf
==> record: /srv/sbx/templates/default-eed901b838bf.json (copy it to the operator's machine for deploy/sbx/template-onboarding/template-register.sh)
==> then, after setup.sh: sudo deploy/sbx/install-host.sh <bundle of sbx_default_eed901b838bf> --snapshot default-eed901b838bf --budget-mb <at least 1888>
```

A 256 MiB guest's snapshot is small; a 4 GiB one is about 7.3 GB (§9).

### 4.3 Register (operator machine)

Copy the record over, then:

```bash
deploy/sbx/template-onboarding/template-register.sh --env-file <env file> default-eed901b838bf.json --apply
```

It adds the worker to `SBX_WORKERS` and the template to the templates file, then runs `setup.sh`.
Only the control plane restarts, so running commands on other templates are not interrupted
(the relay's settings hash was seen to stay the same across two template changes).

### 4.4 Install the worker

Copy the bundle `deploy/sbx/.generated/workers/sbx_default_eed901b838bf` to the host by path (it
holds a token: never print it), then:

```bash
sudo deploy/sbx/install-host.sh <bundle dir> --snapshot default-eed901b838bf --budget-mb 8192
```

Expected: `sbx-worker@sbx_default_eed901b838bf attached to the relay`. The worker first checks the snapshot against its
manifest and against the template record `template-build.sh` left in `$SBX_SRV/templates/`
(`SH_TEMPLATE_RECORD`); a mismatch stops it at start, naming the field. The record's id also becomes
the worker's `SANDBOX_TEMPLATE`, so Moca agent sessions naming the template find it (section 8).

### 4.5 Use it

```bash
mocactl sbx templates
mocactl sbx create --template default --name try-default
mocactl sbx run -- python3 -c 'print(6*7)'
```

## 4b. From an OCI image to a Moca template (self-serve)

For a **general user**: you have a Moca login and an image, and no operator access. Every step goes
through the API (`POST /v1/templates`) and `mocactl sbx`. Moca builds and probes the template on a KVM
host and registers it by policy; nobody approves it. Sections 4 and 5 are the operator's path for the
same result.

The commands that go through the API are as recorded in validation runs (answers abridged; their
ids replaced by placeholders). **Both paths below ran end to end on a KVM host from a user's own
images**, from create to retire, and so did the failures shown with them. Only a template with
`egress: true` on a host that ships its egress is still _(unverified)_: those runs had egress off.

### 4b.1 What you need, and what you get

- **An image, pinned by digest** (`repository@sha256:<64 hex>`), from a registry the deployment's
  policy allows. Read it first: `GET /v1/policy` lists `allowedRegistries` and, per registry,
  `allowedRepositories` (§3). Docker Hub is written with its host: `docker.io/library/python@sha256:…`.
- **A Moca login** (`mocactl sbx login`) and room in your quota (`GET /v1/quota`).
- **You get** a template only you can see, built and probed by Moca, which you activate, use from
  sandboxes or Moca agent sessions, update and retire. Others see it only if you make it
  `deployment`-visible, which a self-attested template can't be until an admin trusts its gate
  record (§4b.5).

### 4b.2 Pick your path: the profile

The profile you name in the create is the gate your template must pass (`GET /v1/policy` lists the
deployment's profiles; a profile exists only once its stored policy lists it):

| Profile          | Gate record                                        | Network                       | Visible to others                         | Use it for                                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `base`           | none                                               | the host's allowlisted egress | if you make it so                         | most templates: a toolchain, an app            |
| `general-self`   | **your own**, passed                               | the host's allowlisted egress | only after an admin trusts the record     | a tested image you want proved, with network   |
| `benchmark-self` | **your own**, passed, its floor proved offline     | none (X11)                    | only after an admin trusts the record     | a benchmark task environment you gate yourself |
| `benchmark`      | one an admin already trusts (`trustedGateRecords`) | none (X11)                    | as the deployment's curated templates are | the curated benchmark images                   |

Most users start with `base` (§4b.4). If you want Moca to hold your template to a test result, gate
it yourself and use a self-attested profile (§4b.5).

### 4b.3 Make your image Moca-ready: the Moca minimum

A stranger's image usually fails as published, for reasons most images share:

- **`/etc/hosts` is empty.** A container runtime writes one when a container starts; a microVM guest
  boots with none, so `localhost` doesn't resolve.
- **The guest agent's minimum is missing**, most often `file`, and any tool your spec's `tools` lists
  (`git`, `rg`, …).
- **`ca-certificates`** is missing. A template with `egress: true` needs it on a host whose egress
  intercepts TLS (egress credentials): Moca bakes that host's CA into the system trust store at build,
  and refuses the build without one. Add it whenever you use egress: it costs little and keeps the
  template portable across hosts.

The fix is a small layer on top of your image: a localhost `/etc/hosts`, the guest minimum, and
`ca-certificates` when the template uses egress. Each path below shows its own. Build it for
`linux/amd64`, push it to an allowed registry, and use the digest the registry gives it.

### 4b.4 Path A: `base`, worked with `python:3.12-slim`

1. **The layer** (a `Containerfile` beside a `hosts` file):

   ```dockerfile
   # The Moca minimum on python:3.12-slim, for a `base` (or `general-self`) template whose tools are bash and
   # python3: a localhost /etc/hosts (a microVM guest boots with none), `file` (the guest agent's minimum),
   # and `ca-certificates` (the system trust store, so Moca can bake a TLS-intercepting host's egress CA in
   # with update-ca-certificates; on such a host a template with egress true is refused at build without it).
   FROM docker.io/library/python:3.12-slim@sha256:5e2bdb1b0d542d5039cffb8181c65930093949194a65c365dfb1b0fe13a4fa5b
   RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq --no-install-recommends file ca-certificates >/dev/null \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
   COPY hosts /etc/hosts
   ```

   `hosts`, exactly these two lines (tab-separated; copy them from the rendered page, since the
   indentation here is the list's):

   ```text
   127.0.0.1	localhost
   ::1	localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
   ```

   _Measured in the image builder's guest emulation: a read-only root, no network, every
   guest-minimum tool present, the probe below printing `(3, 12)`._

2. **The create.** The spec's size must fit the profile's envelope (`base`: up to 16 GiB and 8
   vCPUs):

   ```json
   {
     "id": "my-python",
     "image": "<your registry>/python-moca-min@sha256:<your layered image's digest>",
     "profile": "base",
     "spec": {
       "guest_ram_mb": 4096,
       "vcpus": 2,
       "egress": false,
       "seed": "",
       "skip_git_identity_check": true,
       "tools": ["bash", "python3"],
       "probe": {
         "cmd": "python3 -c 'import sys; print(sys.version_info[:2])'",
         "timeout_s": 60,
         "expect_rc": 0,
         "expect": ["^\\(3, 12\\)$"]
       },
       "description": "Python 3.12"
     }
   }
   ```

   - **`egress: false`** is how it ran; `true` gives the sandbox the host's allowlisted egress
     (§4b.3's `ca-certificates`, and §4b.6's egress records).
   - **`skip_git_identity_check: true`** is how it ran, because this image has no git and the build
     host's snapshot check then failed a git-less image. With the build tooling's check for git-less
     images (an image with no git has no commit to fail), it passes by itself: leave the field out.
     An image that has git should never set it on `base`.
   - The policy also reads the guest size as `guest_mb`; write `guest_ram_mb`, the name the build's
     spec check reads, or the build can fail at its `spec` step.

   `POST /v1/templates` with that body and your API token. A create is answered `202` with the build
   to follow. With mocactl (not yet run against a KVM host), the same create from that body saved
   as `my-python.json`, after the policy's local checks:

   ```bash
   mocactl sbx templates create --spec my-python.json --dry-run   # nothing sent; names a failing rule
   mocactl sbx templates create --spec my-python.json --json      # the answer below
   ```

   ```json
   {
     "templateId": "<id>",
     "buildId": null,
     "build": "/v1/templates/<id>/builds/b-<handle>",
     "status": "queued"
   }
   ```

3. **Follow the build** with `mocactl sbx templates follow <id>` (exit 0 once registered, 1 on
   failed or rejected with the reason, 5 past `--timeout`, 3600 s by default) or
   `GET /v1/templates/<id>/builds/<build>`:
   `queued`, `building`, `probing`, `built`, then `registered` (its build's `attestation`
   `deployment`, since `base` needs no gate record, whatever the template's own visibility).
   `heldBy` names a host once one holds the snapshot.

4. **If it's refused or fails:**
   - **A policy refusal** is `422 policy_refused` naming the rule, before anything is built (for
     example rule X10). A refused create stores no template, but a `check` record of the refusal stays on the
     id's stream.
   - **A failed build** has a `reason` with a `step` and a `code` you can branch on, e.g.
     step `probe` with code `probe_failed` (the probe didn't print what the spec expected). Two
     more: step `spec` with code `spec_refused` (`guest_mb`, above) and step `build` with code
     `build_failed` (no git, above). Section 10 lists the usual causes.

5. **Use it:** activate it (`POST /v1/templates/<id>/activate`; with mocactl,
   `mocactl sbx templates activate my-python --wait`, which polls until active), then
   `mocactl sbx create --template my-python` (`201`). A first use may answer
   `409 template_not_active` with `Retry-After` while a host starts its worker; the retry
   succeeds once it's attached. Behind a host's start limit the build reads `activating` with
   `queued` and its `queuePosition`, and Retry-After estimates the wait; poll with a timeout sized
   for the queue. A Moca agent session names it with `--option sandboxTemplate=<id>@<build>`
   (section 8).

6. **Update and retire:** a new build of the same id (`POST /v1/templates/<id>/builds`), then
   `mocactl sbx templates tag <id> default --build <new build>`; retire with
   `mocactl sbx templates retire <id>` (`--wait` returns once no host holds it). A create after
   that answers `410 template_retired`. A retire is refused while a sandbox or session still uses the build
   (`409 build_in_use`) _(not yet recorded)_.

### 4b.5 Path B: your own gate record (`general-self`, `benchmark-self`)

A gate record is the image builder's file that says your image's environment works. Sections
4b.5.1-4 describe the image builder's gate tool; 4b.5.5-6 are Moca's side.

#### 1. What a gate checks: the environment, not the answer

A gate record says that your image's **environment works**. The gate runs your image's own test
command once, unmodified, as a Moca microVM guest would run it, and asks that the result meet a floor
you state. It applies no change, no fix and no patch, and it never sees a task's answer. Whether an
agent's work is right is **grading's** question, asked later and elsewhere. A gate cannot answer it, and
does not try.

The gate runs your image in an emulation of the guest: a read-only root file system, no network, root,
an empty `/workspace` that it seeds from your work tree, and a clean environment (`env -i`, the guest's
`PATH`, `HOME=/tmp/home`). In that guest it checks:

| Check           | Passes when                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/etc/hosts`    | your image's own file resolves `localhost`. A guest boots with no runtime-written file, so an empty one fails         |
| tools           | the guest agent's minimum (`bash ls cat base64 file`) and every tool your `tools` list names are present              |
| no credentials  | no credential-shaped variable is in the guest's environment                                                           |
| commits refused | git has no identity, so an agent cannot commit, and a clean tree after the seed if your work tree is a git repository |
| the floor       | your test command's exit code, and its passed count (pytest's or unittest's summary), meet `floor`                    |
| absent files    | with `absent_sha256`: no file in the image has one of those sha256s (only a count of matches is kept)                 |
| the probe       | with `probe`: it runs on a fresh seed, and what it prints becomes your template's expectation                         |

#### 2. The input contract (`example-builder/gate-input/1`)

You describe your image in a small JSON file:

| Field            | Required | Meaning                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `schema`         | yes      | the builder's input schema, here `example-builder/gate-input/1`                                                                    |
| `image`          | yes      | your image, pinned: `repository@sha256:<64 hex>`. A public registry is written with its host (`docker.io/library/python@sha256:…`) |
| `workdir`        | yes      | your work tree, an absolute path. The gate copies it into the guest's empty `/workspace`, where the test runs                      |
| `test_cmd`       | yes      | a bash command, run in the work tree                                                                                               |
| `floor`          | yes      | `{"rc": N}`, `{"passed_at_least": N}`, or both. `{"rc": 0}` alone is a valid floor                                                 |
| `absent_sha256`  | no       | sha256s no file in your image may have, such as a task's own tests or its solution                                                 |
| `probe`          | no       | `{"cmd": "…", "public": true}`: a shareable check, never a grading command                                                         |
| `tools`          | no       | the tools your template will list (default `bash git python3 rg`)                                                                  |
| `network_needed` | no       | `true` or absent: your test command cannot pass offline. **`general-self` only**                                                   |

Any other field is refused, and so is `network_needed` with any value but `true`.

#### 3. Running the gate, and the record it writes

```bash
python scripts/gate-image.py contract.json --out gate.json \
    --template-id my-app --spec-out spec.json
```

> **Where the tool is.** `gate-image.py` is the image builder's, and it is not part of Moca yet. Ask
> your Moca admin for a copy, or have the image builder gate your image. Everything below is what it
> does, so you can prepare your image and contract now.

It pulls your image by digest (linux/amd64, as Moca's guests run), and refuses if the digest it got is
not the contract's. It writes the record whether or not the gate passed, prints the record's sha256,
and exits 0 only on a pass. On a pass, `--template-id` also writes a template spec for the
self-attested profiles. Its probe expectation is built from what your probe printed (colour codes
stripped), never from a count.

The record is what you send as `gateRecord` with your create (§4b.5.5). The control plane reads
general-gate records of the schema `SH_GATE_RECORD_SCHEMA` names (default `moca-gate-record/1`), and
these fields:

| Field                                                              | Moca's rule                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `gate.passed`                                                      | X1: the gate passed                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `image.digest`                                                     | X1.image: the record is for your template's image                                                                                                                                                |
| `observed.testbed.agent_can_commit`, `observed.guest.git_identity` | X12: commits refused (`no` and `none`)                                                                                                                                                           |
| `gate.floor_checked_offline`                                       | X1.offline: `true` means the floor was proved with no network. **`benchmark` and `benchmark-self` require it.** It is `false` only for a `network_needed` contract, which `general-self` accepts |
| `gate.floor_met_offline`                                           | present only with `network_needed`: whether the offline run met the floor anyway. `general-self` shows it on your build                                                                          |

The record is unsigned bytes, and **its sha256 is its identity**. It names no person or key. Who
submitted it is what Moca records, and trust follows from that (§4b.5.6). A record never carries a
private registry host, a credential, your test command (only its sha256) or its output (only counts).

#### 4. A worked sample: SWE-bench's django-11133 image, as a stranger would bring it

SWE-bench's own image for django-11133 (`swebench/sweb.eval.x86_64.django_1776_django-11133`, the
image behind §5's template), gated as any user's image, outside the benchmark. The contract names its
work tree `/testbed`, its own test runner on the public `basic` label, and a floor of rc 0 with the
passed count measured. The probe is the same command.

- **As published, the gate refuses it**, correctly, and for reasons most images share: its
  `/etc/hosts` is empty, and it lacks `file` and `rg`. Its tests themselves pass in the guest, commits
  are refused, and it holds no credentials.
- **With the Moca minimum on top (§4b.3), it passes.** Here that's a localhost `/etc/hosts`, plus
  `file` and `ripgrep` from the image's own Ubuntu packages. The gate wrote a spec whose probe expects
  what the runner printed: `^Ran N tests?\b` (N, the total it printed) and `^OK\b`, rc 0. django
  counts skipped tests in `Ran N`, so an expectation rebuilt from the passed count would never
  have matched.

The layer, a `Containerfile` beside a `hosts` file:

```dockerfile
# The Moca minimum, on a stranger's image: a localhost /etc/hosts (a microVM guest boots with none)
# and the tools a template needs that the image lacks.
FROM docker.io/swebench/sweb.eval.x86_64.django_1776_django-11133@sha256:914093363dbe12def92c5d36e9bdc5270cce5ed0aa6f3daad8bc4ef0389c29bf
RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq --no-install-recommends file ripgrep >/dev/null && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
COPY hosts /etc/hosts
```

`hosts`, exactly these two lines (tab-separated):

```text
127.0.0.1	localhost
::1	localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
```

The contract, with your layered image's digest in `image`:

```json
{
  "schema": "example-builder/gate-input/1",
  "image": "<your registry>/django-moca-min@sha256:<the digest of your layered image>",
  "workdir": "/testbed",
  "test_cmd": "source /opt/miniconda3/bin/activate && conda activate testbed && export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LANGUAGE=en_US:en LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 && ./tests/runtests.py --verbosity 2 --settings=test_sqlite --parallel 1 basic",
  "floor": { "rc": 0 },
  "probe": {
    "cmd": "source /opt/miniconda3/bin/activate && conda activate testbed && export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LANGUAGE=en_US:en LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 && ./tests/runtests.py --verbosity 2 --settings=test_sqlite --parallel 1 basic",
    "public": true
  }
}
```

Add `"passed_at_least"` to `floor` with a count you have measured yourself, if you want the gate to
hold the image to it.

_Gated on the image builder's machine, and on a KVM host, where it was built and registered as
`benchmark-self` (§4b.5.5)._

#### 5. Create with your gate record

Send the record's bytes, unchanged, as `gateRecord` with a self-attested profile (as recorded: a
`benchmark-self` create from the layered django-11133 image with its own gate record):

```json
{
  "id": "my-app",
  "image": "<your layered image>@sha256:<digest>",
  "profile": "benchmark-self",
  "gateRecord": "<the contents of gate.json, byte for byte>",
  "spec": { "...": "the spec gate-image.py wrote (spec.json)" }
}
```

- Use `benchmark-self` for a task environment that must stay offline (its record's
  `gate.floor_checked_offline` must be `true`), or `general-self` for one with the host's allowlisted
  egress.
- The build shows `attestation: self`, and your template stays private: making it
  `deployment`-visible answers `409 self_attested`. As recorded: the build registered with
  `attestation: self`; then an activation, a sandbox seeded from the image's `/testbed`
  with its checks passing, and a retire after which a create answers `410`. On the
  provenance chain its `gate` record says `source: self`.
- The refusals you may meet: `X1.self.scope` (a record someone else submitted), `X1.offline` (a
  `network_needed` record on an offline profile), `X12.self` (the record shows commits allowed), and
  `X1.self.egress` (egress on a profile that forbids it).

#### 6. Sharing it: trust

To let others use it, ask an admin to trust the record: its sha256 goes into the policy's
`trustedGateRecords` (`PUT /v1/policy`, a `policy` record names who did it). Its builds then read
as `attestation: deployment`, and you can make the template `deployment`-visible. If the admin later
removes that trust, the builds read as `self` again and fall back to private; the `policy` record
names the builds it narrowed.

### 4b.6 What Moca records, and your sandboxes' network

- **Provenance:** your create, its gate record, every policy check, the build, each activation, each
  sandbox or session on it, and its retire are records on the template's stream, chained by digest.
  Anyone with an export can check them offline (`deploy/sbx/template-onboarding/verify-provenance.py`).
- **Egress records:** for a template with `egress: true`, `mocactl sbx egress <sandbox>` (or
  `GET /v1/sandboxes/<id>/egress`) shows which hosts the sandbox reached, and the sandbox's end
  record names the log's digest and whether it's complete. Paths are logged without query, fragment
  or userinfo, and an injected credential appears by name only, but a secret a guest puts in a URL
  path segment is logged as sent. With egress off (both recorded paths), the log is empty, complete,
  and its digest is the sha256 of no bytes (seen on both paths);
  a log with events is _(unverified)_ on
  a host until one ships them.

### 4b.7 When something's refused (what users hit)

| You see                                              | Why                                                                 | Do                                                                        |

| `422 policy_refused`, rule `registry.repository`     | that registry allows only listed repositories                       | ask an admin to list yours                                                |

| `409 template_exists`                                | the id is someone else's, or one the deployment declares            | another id; an admin can hand a declared id to you (`templates transfer`) |
| a build failed at `probe`                            | the probe printed something else, or `localhost` doesn't resolve    | the Moca minimum (§4b.3); match what the probe prints exactly             |

## 5. Example 2: a SWE-bench instance (django\_\_django-11133)

This is what ran on a validation deployment: a SWE-bench Lite instance, built, checked in a
microVM, registered, used by a client and by an agent, then retired.

### 5.1 The spec comes from the image builder

The result, as it ran, is `examples/django__django-11133.json` in this folder (its image names no
registry host; give it with `--registry`).

The image builder's per-instance record carries the spec under `template`, so nothing is written
by hand. Its `probe` is a **public** test target (`basic`), not the instance's grading tests, and its
image names no registry host:

```bash
jq '.template' <builder record>.json > django__django-11133.json
cp <builder record>.json django__django-11133.gate-record.json
```

The second file is the image's **gate record**, unchanged: the build checks the image against it
(§5.2), and the control plane trusts it by the sha256 of those exact bytes. Both are in `examples/`;
the copy of the gate record there has the gate's own test results removed, so its sha256 is not
the image builder's. Create from the builder's own file, as above.

The fields that matter: `id: django-django-11133` (the instance id lower-cased, `__` → `-`; a
Verified image also in Lite gets `-v`), 4096 MiB and 2 vCPUs, `egress: false`, `seed:
"cp -a /opt/testbed-src/. /workspace/"`, `probe.expect: ["^OK\\b"]` with `expect_rc: 0`, and
`etc_hosts_sha256`.

### 5.2 Build, register, install

```bash
sudo deploy/sbx/template-onboarding/template-build.sh deploy/sbx/template-onboarding/examples/django__django-11133.json --kernel /path/to/vmlinux --registry registry.example.com --gate-record deploy/sbx/template-onboarding/examples/django__django-11133.gate-record.json
```

The spec names its gate record (`source_record_digest`), so the build needs it: before pulling, it
checks the gate passed, the record is for this image, and commits are refused, and the template
record keeps that evidence (gating rules X10 and X12, in `governance/GATING-RULES.md`). The run
below was before this check existed _(the `--gate-record` form is unverified on a host)_.

As it ran (a 4 GiB guest on the host of §9: about 3 minutes, plus the pull; the runner's summary
lines abridged):

```
==> etc/hosts as the spec says
build-snapshot.sh: verify command exited 0; the last of its output:
Ran … tests in …s
OK …
template-build: the probe passed
==> built template django-django-11133: snapshot django-django-11133-3d3e705ff379, worker sbx_django_django_11133_3d3e705ff379
```

Then §4.3 and §4.4 with that record, and **`--no-egress` with `--budget-mb 13408`**: a 4 GiB guest
needs (4096 + 32) × 3 + 1024 MiB for one session at standby depth 2.

### 5.3 A client: seed first

A new sandbox's `/workspace` is empty. **SBX0 does not run the seed: the client does**, as its first
command. And use `sbx create`, not `sbx up`: `up` pushes the client's own repository into
`/workspace` before the seed runs.

```bash
id=$(mocactl sbx create --template django-django-11133 --json | jq -r .id)
mocactl sbx run --sandbox "$id" -- bash -c 'cp -a /opt/testbed-src/. /workspace/ && git -C /workspace log --oneline -1'
mocactl sbx run --sandbox "$id" -- bash -c 'source /opt/miniconda3/bin/activate && conda activate testbed && cd /testbed && ./tests/runtests.py --verbosity 2 --settings=test_sqlite --parallel 1 basic 2>&1 | tail -3'
```

Expected: the seed (1-2 s on the host of §9) with a clean tree at `bc34802 baseline`, then the
runner's `OK`. The guest has no network (`connect: Network is unreachable`), and a token for this
sandbox is `PERMISSION_DENIED` at any other template's worker.

### 5.4 An agent: OpenCode on the template

Point the agent's MCP server at the seeded sandbox (`mocactl sbx mcp --sandbox <id>`), keeping `sbx
up`'s tools-off block, so the agent works only through the sandbox. A headless `opencode run`
with the instance's problem statement used `sandbox_bash`, `sandbox_read` and `sandbox_edit` only.
Take the patch from the sandbox (`git diff --binary <baseline>` in `/workspace`),
not with `sbx pull`, which diffs against the client's repository.

## 6. Two templates side by side: the client chooses

With both examples onboarded, the deployment serves two templates, each on its own worker. The
templates file that `template-register.sh` wrote holds:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "default",
    "worker": "sbx_default_eed901b838bf",
    "description": "Moca's sandbox image: bash, git, Python 3, ripgrep",
    "tools": ["bash", "git", "python3", "rg"]
  },
  {
    "id": "django-django-11133",
    "worker": "sbx_django_django_11133_3d3e705ff379",
    "description": "SWE-bench django__django-11133 (lite) at its baseline bc348023edb4; seed with: cp -a /opt/testbed-src/. /workspace/",
    "tools": ["bash", "git", "python3", "rg"]
  }
]
```

**A client lists them, then picks one per sandbox.** The worker ids never reach the client: it sees
only the id, the description and the tools.

```bash
mocactl sbx templates
```

```
default          Moca's sandbox image: bash, git, Python 3, ripgrep
django-django-11133 SWE-bench django__django-11133 (lite) at its baseline bc348023edb4; seed with: cp -a /opt/testbed-src/. /workspace/
```

(A `default` built from an older sample still shows its earlier spelling, "MOCA's": its
description is part of its record.)

(`--json` gives the same list as JSON, with `tools`.)

A sandbox of each, and a command that tells them apart (only the SWE-bench image has the instance's
repository at `/opt/testbed-src`):

```bash
gen=$(mocactl sbx create --template default --name general --json | jq -r .id)
swe=$(mocactl sbx create --template django-django-11133 --name task --json | jq -r .id)
for s in "$gen" "$swe"; do
  mocactl sbx run --sandbox "$s" -- bash -c 'git -C /opt/testbed-src log --oneline -1 2>/dev/null || echo no-testbed'
done
```

Expected:

```
no-testbed
bc34802 baseline
```

The SWE-bench template also has no network (`egress: false`, checked:
`connect: Network is unreachable`). `default`'s egress (`egress: true`, through the host's
allowlisting proxy, so `git` and `curl` over HTTPS rather than raw TCP) was checked
with SBX0's egress credentials: a second user's sandbox cloned, committed and pushed a branch of a
private repository with its stored PAT, which never entered the sandbox; another user's sandbox got
`401`; deleting the credential revoked it within its cache TTL ([`smoke.sh`](../smoke.sh) step 7).

What SBX0 guarantees, as checked live with two templates (`deploy/sbx/templates-check.sh`, the live
check that comes with the operations documentation):

- the list names every template and **no worker id**;
- each create records the template asked for; an **unknown template is refused** (`no such
template`) and creates nothing;
- each template's sandboxes go to **its own worker**; two sandboxes of one template share the worker
  but **not their workspaces**;
- each sandbox's commands run on **its template's image** (the probe saw each image's digest);
- a token for one template's sandbox sent to the other template's worker is **`PERMISSION_DENIED`**
  at the relay;
- another user cannot see or use the sandbox;
- `sbx up --template` refuses a repository already bound to a sandbox of another template.

The checks ran with `default` and a SWE-bench template, and again with two SWE-bench templates.
To check a deployment yourself, run `templates-check.sh` against two of its templates (the
runbook's section on checking the templates).

## 7. Update and retire

A new image for a template: a new spec with the new digest, then build, register and install again.
The record names a new worker; registering moves the template there and **keeps the old worker** so
its live sandboxes keep working. Once none is left:

```bash
deploy/sbx/template-onboarding/template-register.sh --env-file <env file> --retire <old worker id> --apply
sudo deploy/sbx/install-host.sh --uninstall <old worker id>
```

Removing a template entirely is `--remove ID`. Retiring `django-django-11133` revoked its worker's
token, a create of it was refused (`no such template`), and another template's sandbox created
before kept running.

**Self-serve, through the API** (a deployment with the template store and host agents; shown end to
end): the template's owner does it all, with no operator step.

Point `default` at a new build (new creates use it), then retire the old build, or the whole
template:

```bash
mocactl sbx templates tag django-django-11133 default --build sha256:<new build>
mocactl sbx templates retire django-django-11133 --build sha256:<old build>
mocactl sbx templates retire django-django-11133 --reason 'done'
```

A retire is refused while a sandbox or a session still uses the build (`409 build_in_use`): delete
it first. A retired build is never used again (`410 template_retired`), and the host agent then
removes its worker and snapshot. Every step is a record naming who did it. The owner also changes
the description and visibility (`templates edit`); an admin rejects a build after the fact,
transfers a template (`templates transfer`) and sets quotas (`templates quota`).

The host agent's removal keeps each retired build's sandbox and session **workspaces** for the
janitor (`install-host.sh --janitor`), which frees them once their sandboxes have ended. On a host
without the janitor they stay on disk: about a few hundred MB to a GB per template used, so a long
run of retires fills `/srv/sbx` unless the janitor is installed or the workspaces are removed.

A template the deployment declares (`SH_SANDBOX_TEMPLATES`) has no owner, so a subject cannot create
a self-serve template under the same id (`409 template_exists`). An admin hands it to a subject
(`mocactl sbx templates transfer ID github:<id>`); that subject then builds, tags and
retires it.
A template with a self-attested build (§4b.5) is not transferred to another subject
(`409 self_attested`) until an admin trusts its gate record: the record counts for its submitter's own
templates only.

## 8. Templates in Moca agent sessions

Moca's own agent sessions (Moca Pi, P6) can name a template too: `mocactl run --option
sandboxTemplate=ID`. A worker serves a template when `SANDBOX_TEMPLATE` is set; a session with no
template never lands on one; the harness runs the seed once, before the agent's first tool call.
A templated P4 worker is installed beside the main one with `setup-microvm.sh --template ID
--snapshot DIR`; set-up is in [`P4-ON-P6.md`](../../microvm/P4-ON-P6.md), "A templated P4 worker".
Only one worker per host may use guest egress (moca-egress keys VMs by id, which workers share), so
the installer refuses `--egress` beside another worker that uses it.
Checked live on a Moca-VM (P6+P4), with a scripted mock model: a session naming
`django-django-11133` ran on the templated worker with the repository seeded, its second turn kept
the workspace and did not seed again, a session with no template ran on the untemplated worker, and
an unknown template was refused at creation.

On the **combined control plane** (one control plane for both, `setup.sh SBX_PROFILE=combined`), a
session names a self-serve template the same way, and may pin a build (`ID@sha256:…`): it runs only
on that build's workers. Checked on the cluster and the KVM host, with no model: a
stock-agent sandbox and a session pinned to the same build, and first use through a session (`409
template_not_active`, then created on a retry).

### A session pinned to a build, end to end

On a deployment with the template store (the combined control plane, an image with pinned-build sessions):

- **The seed is the build's own.** The harness seeds the session's workspace from the pinned build's
  `spec.seed`, the same seed a stock agent's client reads for that build, and reports where it came
  from: `sandbox.seed: {source: "build", buildId: "sha256:…"}` in the turn's result. A client checks
  that `buildId` equals its pin. (`source: "declared"` is a template from `SH_SANDBOX_TEMPLATES`.)
- **The turn returns the patch.** After each turn on a templated session, the result carries
  `workspace: {baseline, patch, patchSha256, patchBytes}`: the whole workspace's diff from the commit
  the seed left (`git diff --cached --binary` on a throwaway index, Moca's own `.moca-*` files left
  out), also on the terminal `done` and `error` frames, so `mocactl run --json` prints it. It is
  never truncated: over `SH_TURN_PATCH_MAX_BYTES` (4 MiB by default) `patch` is left out and
  `patchRefused: "too_large"` says so; a patch that is not UTF-8 comes as `patchBase64`; a failed
  capture is `{error}` and does not fail the turn. Each turn's patch is the whole end state, so a
  client takes the last turn's. Extract it with `jq -j` (shell `$(…)` drops the trailing newline, and
  the checksum then differs).
- **Creating the session for `ID@build`:** today `mocactl run --option sandboxTemplate=` accepts
  only the deployment's declared ids, and refuses `ID@sha256:…` before sending anything. Create the session through the API, then run it:

  ```bash
  curl -sS -X POST -H @<header file with your api token> -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"sandbox": {"template": "django-django-11133@sha256:<build>"}, "model": "<model id>", "credentials": {"inference": "<name>"}}' https://sbx-api.example.com/v1/sessions
  mocactl run "<prompt>" --session <sessionId> --json
  mocactl sessions delete <sessionId>
  ```

  A first create on an inactive template is `409 template_not_active` with `Retry-After`: retry.
  Without the gateway's host in `SH_MODEL_CATALOG_HOSTS`, the model id is accepted unverified
  (`modelVerified: false`) and `GET /v1/sessions/{id}` shows it.

- **Provenance:** a `session` record at create (its lease's `activate` record and its build) and one
  at delete, on the template's stream, as a sandbox has. A session that is never deleted has no end
  record: delete each session when its work is done (an active pinned session also blocks the
  build's retire).

**Validated** (the combined control plane on the cluster, workers on the KVM host, a real model):
on SWE-bench templates built fresh, a stock agent (OpenCode) on a sandbox and Moca Pi on a session,
both pinned to the same build. Each session was seeded from its build and returned its patch
whole, and the provenance records of both kinds of client composed into one chain per build.

## 9. Capacity

Measured on one KVM host (188 GiB of memory, 93 GB of disk free on the volume holding `/srv/sbx`),
with SWE-bench templates of 4 GiB guests, image pulls included in the build times:

| Limit               | Rule                                                                                                                            | Measured                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| disk, templates     | 7.3-13.6 GB per snapshot; `template-build.sh` wants `SBX_MIN_FREE_GB` (50 by default) free                                      | 8 built in 31 min (140-515 s each, ~70 GB); room for about one more                                     |
| memory per template | each attached worker keeps its snapshot's memory mapped, idle or not                                                            | ~4.1 GiB each                                                                                           |
| disk, sandboxes     | each seeded sandbox's workspace                                                                                                 | 75-240 MB each; 25 sandboxes over 8 templates and 2 users took ~3.5 GB, and disk stopped the test first |
| commands at once    | `--budget-mb` ≥ (guest + 32) × (running VMs) + 1024; a **running** VM is charged its full guest size, a standby its dirty pages | 3 per worker at 13408 MiB; every one at 65536 MiB, with almost no real memory used                      |
| quotas              | `SBX_MAX_PER_SUBJECT`, `SBX_MAX_TOTAL`                                                                                          | deployment settings                                                                                     |

So on a host like this, disk limits templates and sandboxes before memory does, and the default
budget allows far fewer commands at once than memory holds: raise `--budget-mb` for parallel runs.

**A worker's first start is cold.** It reads its snapshot's memory file from disk (4 GiB for a
4 GiB guest). With snapshots on a general-purpose cloud block volume of about 125 MB/s, cold 4 GiB
starts one at a time took 78 s on average (at most 120 s; the runbook's cold-start pacing has the
measurement). Two settings shorten it: the verify cache,
which spares the re-hash of files already checked on the host (`P4-ON-P6.md`), and
`install-host.sh`'s snapshot read-ahead (`SBX_READ_AHEAD_KB`, the runbook's "Snapshot read-ahead").
A host starts at most `SBX_START_CONCURRENCY` workers at once; a client's activation waits its turn
(`activating`, `queued`, §4b.4).

**Size the budget for the work run at once on the template, not for one session.**
`template-build.sh`'s `min_budget_mb`, (guest + 32) × 3 + 1024 (13408 MiB for a 4 GiB guest), fits
about two running VMs plus a standby. Two agents working one template at once, each with
back-to-back commands, then hit admission refusals (`memory-budget: promoting a standby …`).
Allow one running VM per command that may run at once: **17536 MiB for four 4 GiB VMs**, which two
agents on one template used with no refusal. The worker's start-up warning (slots × per-VM size against
the budget) is expected at any budget below its slot count.

**A refused command never ran, and the clients retry it** (the retry contract of #728). `mocactl sbx
run` and `sbx put` retry an Exec the worker or relay refused before it started (`template_busy`,
`busy`), with backoff of 1, 2, 4 and 8 s (`MOCACTL_SBX_BUSY_RETRIES`, 4 by default, 0 to turn off),
and exit **75** when every try is refused. The static client (`remote-worker/cmd/sbx`, and its Python twin) does the same within
`SBX_BUSY_RETRY_S` (30 s by default) and logs each refusal. **125** stays for every other sandbox
failure, where the command may have run.
