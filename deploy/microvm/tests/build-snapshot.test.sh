# and cannot run on every PR -- but its CONTRACT can rot silently, and a rotted
# contract produces a snapshot the worker then refuses at start (or worse, accepts):
#
#   - the manifest must carry the five fields vmpool.LoadManifest requires, or every
#     worker on the fleet fails its startup verification at once.
#   - the snapshot must be built on the target instance type (spec §2.4: restore
#     requires identical hardware), so the script must RECORD the type rather than
#     leaving it blank.
#   - the artifact must be root-owned and read-only (spec §5.5): only a 64-bit CRC
#     guards the state file and the VMM trusts these files.
#   - the agent must be static (CGO_ENABLED=0): the rootfs is minimal and a dynamic
#     agent would need a libc the image may not carry.
