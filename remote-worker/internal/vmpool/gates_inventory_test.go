// WHAT CI ACTUALLY ENFORCES ABOUT SPEC §8, WRITTEN DOWN WHERE A READER WILL SEE IT.
//
// Six of §8's gates — the ones that ARE the isolation argument for this tier — need
// /dev/kvm and a golden snapshot built by deploy/microvm/build-snapshot.sh. Standard
// GitHub runners have neither: no nested virtualisation, and the snapshot is a multi-GiB
// artefact built on the instance generation that will restore it (spec §2.4 requires
// identical hardware, so it cannot be a cached CI blob either). They therefore CANNOT be
// switched on in CI, and until this file existed nothing in the tree said so: every
// automated run skipped them silently and appeared green, which reads as "the gates pass".
//
// So the honest arrangement, in three parts:
//
//  1. The gates that need no hardware run on every PR — CI's `microvm-gates` job runs
//     them with -v so each one is named in the log, and fails if the set that ran is
//     empty.
//  2. The gates that need a rig run from .github/workflows/microvm-kvm-gates.yml, a
//     manual (workflow_dispatch) job that sets SH_KVM=1 on a KVM-capable runner. It is
//     opt-in because there is no such runner in this repository's fleet; what it does is
//     make the command reproducible and the prerequisite explicit rather than tribal.
//  3. This test, which fails if the classification below stops matching the code. A gate
//     that quietly acquires requireKVM, or a new §8 gate nobody classified, would
//     otherwise slip from column 1 to column 2 with no reader the wiser — the exact
//     failure mode of the original gap.
//
// TestTheGateInventoryMatchesTheCode is the drift check; TestTheCIWorkflowsRunTheGates
// pins that (1) and (2) still exist.

// ciCoveredGates run on every PR. The value says why the gate needs no hardware — a gate
// listed here that in fact needs a VM would be a false claim of coverage, which is the
// dangerous direction, so the AST check below verifies each one really is unconditional.
