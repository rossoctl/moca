/**
 * Ends a server-streaming exec call with a non-OK status.
 *
 * `call.destroy(err)` does NOT do that, which is the trap this helper exists to name. On
 * @grpc/grpc-js 1.14.4 a `ServerWritableStream` sends its status from `_final` (which calls
 * `call.sendStatus`), and Node's `Writable` never reaches `_final` once `destroyed` is set:
 * `end()` short-circuits with ERR_STREAM_DESTROYED. Destroying therefore sends no trailers
 * at all -- verified against a real client, which sat for 12s with no status, no `end` and
 * no `error`. A hang is strictly worse than the wrong-OK of #295, because an OK at least
 * lets the caller finish its request.
 *
 * Emitting 'error' is the supported path: grpc-js registers a listener in the stream's
 * constructor that runs the error through `serverErrorToStatus` and then ends the stream,
 * which is what actually puts a code on the wire. `serverErrorToStatus` takes a numeric
 * `code` and a string `details` when present, and otherwise reports UNKNOWN with `message`
 * as the details -- so a bare Error still terminates non-OK and still carries its reason.
 *
 * `main-exec-status.transport.test.ts` pins all of this over a real transport; a fake call
 * object cannot, because the status is produced by the transport rather than the handler.
